    <h4>A Short Story About Our Independence</h4>
    <p>
      Independence Day, in India, national holiday celebrated annually on August
      15. Independence Day marks the end of British rule in 1947 and the
      establishment of a free and independent Indian nation. It also marks the
      anniversary of the partition of the subcontinent into two countries, India
      and Pakistan, which occurred at midnight on August 14–15, 1947. (In
      Pakistan, Independence Day is celebrated on August 14.)British rule in
      India began in 1757 when, following the British victory at the Battle of
      Plassey, the English East India Company began exercising control over the
      country. The East India Company ruled India for 100 years, until it was
      replaced by direct British rule (often referred to as the British raj) in
      the wake of the Indian Mutiny in 1857–58. The Indian independence movement
      began during World War I and was led by Mohandas K. Gandhi,

      who advocated
      for a peaceful and nonviolent end to British rule. Independence Day is
      marked throughout India with flag-raising ceremonies, drills, and the
      singing of the Indian national anthem. Additionally, various cultural
      programs are made available in the state capitals. After the prime
      minister participates in the flag-raising ceremony at the Red Fort
      historic monument in Old Delhi, a parade ensues with members of the armed
      forces and police. The prime minister then delivers a televised address to
      the country, recounting the major accomplishments of India during the
      previous year and outlining future challenges and goals. Kite flying has
      also become an Independence Day tradition, with kites of various sizes,
      shapes, and colours filling the sky. Also, to commemorate the day,
      government offices in New Delhi remain lit throughout the holiday, even
      though they are closed.
